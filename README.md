# Daily Calorie Tracker

This is a simple Python program that helps the user log meals and calculate total and average calories for the day.  
It also compares the total calories with the user's daily calorie limit and gives a warning if the limit is crossed.

This project is made as a 1st semester B.Tech PPS (Python) mini assignment.

- `input()` for user input  
- Type conversion (`int`, `float`)  
- Variables and basic arithmetic  
- `if-else` conditions  
- For loop  
- File handling (`open`, write mode)
